		F.O.S.K.
	Lua-based PSP TEXT Input
	  mrn at post dot cz
============================================

ToDo:
-----

 - new line hiba es hulyen is irja
 - kottajelek 
 - to slow down the processor if not really used
 - Insert
 - Shifting the text Left/Right if necessary
 - Copy/Cut/Paste, Del in Blocks (Del requires 2 buttonpresses per char!! now.)
 - memorize last dir, ie. ini file .)
 - memorize the file name, ask for changes at save
 - ? at starting to make a new file or to read one.
 - check file overwriting if SaveAs
 - check for "save changes" before Exit (Maybe move Exit as part of FOSK..)

Known bugs:
-----------

-Back leaves a copy of the actual line when jumping a line up
- sometimes when the cursor reach eof -> crash
